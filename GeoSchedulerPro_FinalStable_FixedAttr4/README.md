GeoSchedulerPro_FinalStable_FixedAttr4 - README

This plugin reprojects centroids from origin/destination layers into the road network CRS (as requested),
adds debug centroid layers option, and performs reduced OD point-to-point routing.
It now includes robust handling for shapefile field creation and will silently skip writes if the shapefile is locked or read-only.
